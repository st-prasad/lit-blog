# LLM (Large Language Models) for **Whiteboards**

![Placeholder Image](/images/download.png "This is a placeholder image")


LLMs, or **Large Language Models**, have the potential to revolutionize many fields, including digital whiteboards. These AI models can generate _human-like text_, making them useful for a variety of tasks.

## The Power of LLMs

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to generate accurate, contextually appropriate responses. This capability can be harnessed in digital whiteboards to enhance collaboration and productivity.

For instance, an LLM could:
- Generate ideas for **brainstorming sessions**
- Write summary notes of the discussions
- Provide explanations or context for _complex topics_
